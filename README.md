# The NFFM Manifesto

Nano-Fabrication, as a tool, should be available to hobbyists and students at low-cost. Currently, one must either have access to an academic microfabrication lab or enough money to pay for semiconductor/MEMS fabrication by the nanotechnology industry.

This is similar to the 3D printer space in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Once open-source 3D printers became available, the cost of 3D printers and 3D prints dropped dramatically and quality and level of innovation skyrocketed.

We believe that the same will happen in the nanofabrication space. Once nanofabrication equipment becomes open-source and available to anyone at low-cost, the cost of experimentation will drop dramatically.

Low-cost nanofabrication equipment will not match the level of precision or quality of high-end nanofabrication processes, but it's quite feasible that it could match processes from 15-20 years ago. These would still be very useful for MEMS and lower-performance integrated circuits.

The ultimate goal is to have a set of open-source hardware and software tools that hobbyists can build and use for 1000-2000 USD.
